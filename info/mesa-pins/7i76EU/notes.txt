OUTPUT MODES
The 7I76EU field outputs are flexible and can support sourcing, sinking, and push
pull modes. These modes are selectable on a per output basis with the source and sink
parameters. These parameters are a 16 bit numbers where each bit determines the mode
of the corresponding output. Sourcing mode is enabled for a given output by having the
corresponding bit set to ‘1' in the source parameter and set to ‘0' in the sink parameter.
Sinking mode is similarly enabled by setting the corresponding sink bit to ‘1' and source
bit to ‘0'. Push-pull mode is selected by setting both bits for a given output to ‘1'
In sourcing mode with standard 24V field power, +24V connects to the 7I76Us field
power input (on TB1) and the outputs on TB5 and TB6 that are in sourcing mode now
source +24V power to loads when on. Loads on outputs in sourcing mode will have the
common side returned to ground or the negative lead of the 24V supply. In sinking mode,
the load common would connect to +24V and be activated when the 7I76EU outputs in
sinking mode ground the output.

hm2_7i76e.0.7i76.0.0.spinmode

If spinmode is zero, 7I76E compatible ENA/DIR mode is used.
If spinmode is non-zero, FWD/REV mode is used.
